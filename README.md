# Ames Iowa Housing Data

This Project was apart of the General Assembly Data Science Immersive course that I took. This Project was completed during week 3 of the course after we learned about simple linear regression techniques.  We were supposed to apply linear regression techniques to a training dataset and predict on the test dataset that we received. One of your instructors set this up as a private Kaggel competition for the class. 

### Data
 - This data was given to me as a train and test set from my instructors at General Assembly. It included Ames Iowa housing sell information about houses sold in the year 2006 to 2010. 
 
 ### Results
  - As this was a Kaggle competition I was able to place in the top half of our class of 40 something students. If I were to do this again I would use a lot more advanced techniques that I have learned since this project and be able to do a better job at discovering more about this dataset before I started building models for it.
